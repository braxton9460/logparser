# Log Parser
This is **very beta** software that has been mostly hacked together.
It needs various improvements, including (but not limited to)

- Making the configuration options passable via either a config file or command line arguments
- Likely converting to use the prometheus golang library so we aren't hacking this together (I didn't know it existed when I started)
